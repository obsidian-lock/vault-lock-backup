# Changelog

Each release's section below becomes its GitHub release notes. Versions follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

## 1.3.0 — 2026-11-01

Pairing: install with BRAT, choose a passphrase, and the backup sets itself up. No server
address or password to type, copy or publish.

- **Pairing:** on first start the plugin makes up its own login and key and sends only a
  bcrypt hash of the key to the server's pairing inbox. While pairing is open the server
  accepts the first computer that asks, gives it its own folder, and closes pairing. See
  the README's [Pairing](README.md#pairing) section.
- **One folder per computer:** a paired computer sees only its own folder on the server, so
  a stranger who pairs never sees your notes.
- **Self-healing:** if the server revokes this computer's login, the plugin asks to pair
  again every minute and reconnects once pairing is open (`vlb open --into` continues the
  old folder).
- New status bar states: `Backup: pairing…` and `Backup: ⚠ not paired`.
- `status.json` now includes the computer's name.
- Server: `server/vlb` (pairing and computer admin), a second container for the pairing
  inbox, a 15-second systemd timer, and an updated Caddy snippet. The WebDAV image is
  pinned.
- The setup command no longer needs server details; without them the plugin pairs.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-10-31

- **Settings are only about the passphrase and the lock:** passphrase, idle minutes, lock
  on focus loss, and the private folder. The backup status, server fields, backup buttons,
  full-check interval and exclude list are gone from the settings. The backup is configured
  by the setup command and runs by itself; the server can still change its options through
  `_control/config.json`.
- The *Back up now*, *Reset backup index* and *Restore vault from server* commands are
  still in the command palette.

## 1.1.1 — 2026-10-29

- **Lock screen:** window titles stay "Obsidian" while locked, in the main window and in
  pop-out windows. Before, Obsidian could put the open note's name back in the title.
- **Lock screen:** the Settings window closes when the vault locks. Obsidian 1.14 opens
  Settings in its own window, which the lock overlay doesn't cover.
- The plugin's author is now listed as obsidian-lock.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-10-29

Zero-setup install: the only thing a user does is choose a passphrase.

- **Setup command for Windows:** [`install.ps1`](install.ps1) installs the plugin and BRAT
  into the vault, writes the server details, and turns both on. Safe to run again.
- **Passphrase prompt:** asked for on first start (and at every start until set). New
  *Set or change passphrase* command.
- **Backup is always on** once a server is set; the *Enable backup* switch is gone.
- **Simpler settings:** the passphrase and a live backup status. Everything else is under
  *Advanced*, and server fields apply together with *Save and test*.
- CI tests the setup command on Windows PowerShell 5.1.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-10-29

First release.

- **Lock screen:** passphrase overlay at launch, after N idle minutes, when the window loses
  focus (optional), and on the *Lock vault now* command. Hotkeys and the command palette are
  blocked while locked. The passphrase is stored only as a PBKDF2-SHA256 hash.
- **Private folder:** a top-level folder (default `Private`) is renamed to a dot-folder while
  locked, so Obsidian ignores it, and on Windows it also gets the hidden attribute.
- **One-way WebDAV backup:** the whole vault as plain files, kept correct by a single
  reconcile against a server-side index. Deleted and renamed-away files go to
  `_trash/<timestamp>/`; nothing on the server is ever deleted. Includes *Reset backup
  index* and *Restore vault from server*.
- **Server-side control:** `_control/config.json` (settings overrides),
  `_control/commands.json` (`reconcile`, `reset-index`, `lock`, `pull`, `restore-all`) and
  `_control/status.json` (health report).
